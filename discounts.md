## Courses Summary

See each course's summary below.

### [Practical Java : spring Boot REST API with Elasticsearch](https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-java-spring-boot-rest-api-with-elasticsearch/?referralCode=969C69DFD8DB853DFA1D)

It will teach you great detail about REST API in Java. That course (REST API) along with message broker (Kafka/RabbitMQ), is a foundation for microservice architecture. Taking both will surely give you great benefit and up-to-date knowledge. For the data storage, we will use Elasticsearch -a popular text-based search engine-


### [REST API Security with Java Spring Boot - What & How](https://www.udemy.com/course/rest-api-security-with-java-spring-boot-what-how/?referralCode=1BD24AF33EB41F3336C3)

Now that you know how to write API on Spring, you must secure it. API is useful, but unsecured API can cost you money, or damage your reputation. In this course, you will learn possible attack that might attack your API, and more importantly, how to prevent them. Protect your API, don't let somebody stealing data from your API, or giving any dangerous data through a hole in the API.


### [REST API Design, Management, Monitoring & Analytics](https://www.udemy.com/course/rest-api-management-monitoring-analytics-kong-open-source/?referralCode=D4408DA8631D20FE5231)

Building REST API is fun. But managing many of APIs can be a headache. Still, you need to manage and analyze those API for various reasons. This course will teach you to use open source tools to manage, monitor, and analyze your APIs. 

No matter what is your programming language, this course will works!


### [RabbitMQ & Java (Spring Boot) for System Integration](https://www.udemy.com/course/rabbitmq-java-spring-boot-for-system-integration/?referralCode=EDF8F951AEA91A4D4C75)

A popular alternative product to Apache Kafka. It has some other features that Kafka don't have (and vice versa). This will enrich your knowledge about message broker, since RabbitMQ and Apache Kafka are two popular message brokers nowadays.


### [Java Spring & Apache Kafka Bootcamp - Basic to Complete](https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-kafka-with-java-spring-boot-theory-hands-on-coding/?referralCode=5C42CAF98051BB9CBA0A)

An alternative to RabbitMQ, with some similiarities (and some differences). If you're interested in real-time, asynchronous messaging, with crazy-high performance, then learning Kafka will be a great value.  
Oh, by the way, Kafka is very well-known for big data streaming plaform. In this course, you will also learn real-time data transformation using Spring Kafka Stream.  
This bootcamp will teach you how to use Apache Kafka with Java Spring, start from basic core kafka, kafka stream, kafka connect, kafka schema registry, json / avro data format, kafka rest proxy, and ksqlDB. All in one complete course.


### [Microservice Pattern & Architecture with Java Spring Boot & Google Cloud](https://www.udemy.com/course/microservice-pattern-architecture-java-spring-cloud-boot/?referralCode=1C822DAF42A54D36CD56)

You've learned REST API & Message Broker and need to use them on real life. So you decide to move to microservice architecture. BAD NEWS! It is difficult! Designed poorly, and the code might give more headache rather than benefit. GOOD NEWS is : this course is designed for you to learn about popural architectural patterns for microservice to avoid common pitfalls during microservice implementation. This course comes with full sample code in Java Spring Cloud & Boot (although we will not learn line-by-line on coding). 


### [Code GraphQL Application With Java Spring Boot & Netflix DGS](https://www.udemy.com/course/code-graphql-application-with-java-spring-boot-netflix-dgs/?referralCode=CF435DB5AF1257C6AFF2)

Some says GraphQL is "REST API killer", "The next REST API", et cetera. But what is GraphQL and why facebook, netflix, github, and some large names shift their technology to GraphQL? Is it true that GraphQL is "REST API killer"? Or the contrary, it is "REST API friend"?  In this course, we will learn the GraphQL fundamentals, including data types, schemas, and graphql operations. We will learn using Java Spring Boot and Netflix DGS framework to easily build GraphQL Java application. In this course, we will not only learn theories, but do a hands-on coding using PostgreSQL as database.


### [Basic Data Engineering for Beginner using Google Cloud & Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/basic-data-engineering-for-beginner-using-google-cloud-python/?referralCode=FB0B3570D682E10F103F)

So what isthis hype about "data engineering". How it's differ with "software engineering"? In this course, you will learn first stem to become data engineer using SQL and Python, and google cloud as infrastructure. Learn about data warehouse, data lake, ETL, et cetera.


### [Data Engineering with Google BigQuery & Google Cloud](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-engineering-cloud-google-bigquery-data-studio/?referralCode=9ECB6D5FE7AEFB5F4C77)

Big data is everywhere! But building one infrastructure for Big Data is costly and takes time. Fortunately, we have Google BigQuery for help us. Learn about Data Engineering using Google BigQuery, Data Studio, and some other Google Cloud product. Also learn data ingestion using free tools like logstash, embulk, or kafka. 


### [A Journey : Digital Transformation & Modernization Roadmap](https://www.udemy.com/course/digital-transformation-modernization-journey-roadmap/?referralCode=5736D1D6C0AB21C19E8F)

"Digital transformation" is a hot keyword lately. This course -unlike the others- is not purely technical. This is like my journey log for doing digital transformation in a company that has been established for many years. I will share both non-technical & technology aspects for doing digital transformation. This course is a journey, and my journey has not finished yet, so I will try to regularly update the course when I reach new milestone.  
Tip : Do you know? You can buy the course now, and get free update forever! So you don't need to wait the journey ends.
